- Everything sports but Chelsea FC occupied a dedicated corner in my heart since â€˜11
- Watching Documentaries. Travelling back in time through human narrations, nothing like it!
- Finding magic in People
- Having no Spotify playlist but exploring new music (TY Spotify Algos)
- Morning/late night walks
- Dogs, sometimes cats.
- Coming across Minimal designs which has depth

### **Believes**

- Decentralisation and it's way forward
- People building the Indian Startup ecosystem.

- ..And in himself

### **Fears**
- Watching Horror movies

p.s. : I sometimes love structured written notes with crisp details. It takes less energy to finish up the blog :p

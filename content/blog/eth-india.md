[ETHIndia](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj63I7M57D8AhWQSWwGHcOPDfYQFnoECBAQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fethindia.co%2F&usg=AOvVaw1C4FhHPgZJFTqblbi6KvDX) was an unforgettable experience and a major milestone in my career. As the operations lead, I had the unique opportunity to help organize the world's biggest Ethereum hackathon, bringing together developers, designers, and entrepreneurs from all over the world to work on innovative projects that leverage the power of Ethereum to solve real-world problems.

The hackathon was a three-day sprint, with it’s share of spontaneous challenges. Some which i anticipated and some which no one did :)

As you might expect, organizing an event of this scale was no easy feat. There were many operational difficulties and challenges we faced as a team, but we were able to overcome it together. As clichè as it sounds, but these are the times when synergies between the team goes through the test of time. We did flourish. how did we? well, we didn’t read a pragmatic playbook but every individual took complete ownership, dropping the weight off from others.

We received 25k+ applications from across cultures and clocked 1,500 + attendees at a 1,18,403.00 Sq feet venue that could accommodate hundreds of people, there was a lot to keep track of. We had to make sure everyone had a place to sleep, food to eat, and a stable internet connection. Unfortunately, we ran into wifi issues during the course of the hackathon. I am joting down Geekyscoders view here. My aim is to not let the same scenario happen again and if it does, you are somewhat ready now.

I don’t shy away from publicly writing my learning’s and if the below pointers help someone. It’s a win for me :)

1. Running a hackathon is like a stage play - a seconds delay in an event is 1 hour occurring in real life (time)
2. Over anticipate each scenario
3. Learn to figure shit out. You will get better with time.
4. Take timely rest before the event. You need to run the show and there is no other way out if you get unwell.
5. You should love to explore uncharted territory of problems and depart with a decent solution.

That being said, One of the highlights of the event for me was getting to meet Andrew from the [ETHGlobal](https://ethglobal.com/) team. His percpectives on scenarios will help give a better hackathon experience moving forward. He was an amazing resource, a great mentor, and a good friend towards the end.

Overall, organizing ETHIndia was a huge undertaking, but it was worth it. It was an incredible opportunity to bring together people from all over the world to work on exciting projects and push the boundaries of what's possible with Ethereum. If you have the chance to be a part of something like this, I highly recommend it. It's an experience you'll never forget.

<!-- # My name is Calvin -->
 

I lead operations and currently building for myself at [Devfolio](https://devfolio.co). I like to contribute on many levels, all the way from initiatives to people. I am a people person, and I care more about empathetic teams than extremely crisp business narratives.

I learn best by building stuff and getting my hands dirty. If you want to talk about tech, life, finance or about anything else that makes you roll - feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter - @thisiscalvin_](https://mobile.twitter.com/thisiscalvin_)

Very often, I find myself in the think-wish-forget loop. I created this blog as a way for me to get out of this loop and start to think-do-iterate. The fact that there are overwhelmingly vast amounts of pure knowledge everywhere on the internet, I was fascinated by the idea of having my own corner where I can post my little perspectives on them.

I identify strongly as an absurdist, a worldview that drives everything I do. I have a bleak view of the future thanks to human-made climate change, humanity's callous penchant for environmental and ecological destruction, and its irrational hatred for fellow beings

I discovered the idea of people synergy sometime in 2018 post my stint with Morgan Stanley and Posist.I have been going down the rabbit hole ever since. These days, I am trying to bring back the magazine culture. It’s WIP and details are to be out soon.

That said, I am fortunate to be in a position where what I do every day is exactly what I have unconditionally enjoyed doing for a few years — Operations, tinkering, and experimenting.

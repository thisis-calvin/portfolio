# My name is Calvin
 

I lead operations and currently building for myself at [Devfolio](https://devfolio.co). I like to contribute on many levels, all the way from initiatives to people. I am a people person, and I care more about empathetic teams than extremely crisp business narratives.

I learn best by building stuff and getting my hands dirty. If you want to talk about tech, life, finance or about anything else that makes you roll - feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter - @thisiscalvin_](https://mobile.twitter.com/thisiscalvin_)

Very often, I find myself in the think-wish-forget loop. I created this blog as a way for me to get out of this loop and start to think-do-iterate. The fact that there are overwhelmingly vast amounts of pure knowledge everywhere on the internet, I was fascinated by the idea of having my own corner where I can post my little perspectives on them.

While constantly juggling through all kinds of emotions and experiences that life has to throw at me, I feel collected and resolved when I come across articles that inspire me in the most grounded manner, providing the most practical approach to forming a constructive habit. One such treasure is [Linus’s blog](https://thesephist.com/), and I’m shamelessly using his theme [Carlisle](https://carlisle-thesephist.vercel.app/) as a base for my blog as it hits just the right chord with my current writing needs. I will work on my own version of the design on the side and release that when ready. No promises.

That said, I am fortunate to be in a position where what I do every day is exactly what I have unconditionally enjoyed doing for a few years — Operations, tinkering, and experimenting.

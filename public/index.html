    <!-- # My name is Calvin -->
<p>I lead operations and currently building for myself at <a href="https://devfolio.co">Devfolio</a>. I like to contribute on many levels, all the way from initiatives to people. I am a people person, and I care more about empathetic teams than extremely crisp business narratives.</p>
<p>I learn best by building stuff and getting my hands dirty. If you want to talk about tech, life, finance or about anything else that makes you roll - feel free to reach out to me on <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/thisiscalvin_">Twitter - @thisiscalvin_</a></p>
<p>Very often, I find myself in the think-wish-forget loop. I created this blog as a way for me to get out of this loop and start to think-do-iterate. The fact that there are overwhelmingly vast amounts of pure knowledge everywhere on the internet, I was fascinated by the idea of having my own corner where I can post my little perspectives on them.</p>
<p>I identify strongly as an absurdist, a worldview that drives everything I do. I have a bleak view of the future thanks to human-made climate change, humanity&rsquo;s callous penchant for environmental and ecological destruction, and its irrational hatred for fellow beings</p>
<p>I discovered the idea of people synergy sometime in 2018 post my stint with Morgan Stanley and Posist.I have been going down the rabbit hole ever since. These days, I am trying to bring back the magazine culture. It’s WIP and details are to be out soon.</p>
<p>That said, I am fortunate to be in a position where what I do every day is exactly what I have unconditionally enjoyed doing for a few years — Operations, tinkering, and experimenting.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a product engineer currently building for <a href="https://github.com/palcodes">myself</a>. I like wearing many hats when building products, pretty much everything from making design decisions to writing the application to taking it to production <em>[something I need to do more].</em> While doing this is of course not easy, we can achieve greatness with just a bunch of good people around.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve built a couple of apps that I am proud of, each one defining a step in my process of learning. I want to continue doing so while working on interesting projects with amazing people.</p>
<p>I like writing, but very often I find myself in the <strong>think-wish-forget</strong> loop. But today is one of those days when I shut up and do what I set out to do which is <strong>think-do-iterate</strong>. While constantly juggling through all kinds of emotions, experiences that life has to throw at me, I feel collected, resolved when I come across articles that inspire me in the most grounded manner, providing the most practical approach to forming a constructive habit. One such treasure is <a href="https://thesephist.com">Linus&rsquo;s blog</a> and I&rsquo;m shamelessly using his theme <a href="https://carlisle.thesephist.vercel.app">Carlisle</a> as a base for my blog as it hit just the right chords with my current writing needs. I will on the side, work on my own version of the design and will release that when ready. No promises.</p>
<p>I want this blog to be a public collection of my musings about life, tech, travel, football and everything in between.</p>
